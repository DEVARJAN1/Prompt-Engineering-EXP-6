# Automated Multi-AI Tool Integration Using Python

## Aim
The aim of this experiment is to develop and implement Python code that integrates with multiple AI tools through APIs. The code will automate the task of interacting with these APIs, compare the generated responses, and produce actionable insights. This lab provides an opportunity to understand how to interact with external AI services, handle JSON data, and utilize basic natural language processing (NLP) techniques for comparative analysis.

## Software Required
To complete this lab experiment, the following software and services are required:

1. **Python (Version 3.8 or higher)**: The primary programming language used for coding and integration.
2. **Python IDE**: Examples include Jupyter Notebook or VS Code for writing and executing Python code.
3. **Python Libraries**:
   - `requests`: To make HTTP requests to AI APIs.
   - `openai`: For accessing OpenAI API services.
   - `difflib`: A standard library module for comparing sequences (used for response similarity analysis).
4. **API Services**:
   - **OpenAI API**: Provides access to GPT models for text generation.
   - **Hugging Face API**: Provides access to various NLP models like BERT.
5. **API Keys**: Obtain API keys from OpenAI and Hugging Face by creating developer accounts.

## Key Concepts
This experiment covers several fundamental concepts in API integration and natural language processing:

- **API Integration**: Establishing a connection with external AI tools via HTTP requests and handling JSON responses.
- **Text Generation**: Using language models (e.g., GPT-3, BERT) to generate responses based on input prompts.
- **Response Comparison**: Analyzing text responses using similarity measures to identify differences or similarities between outputs.
- **Actionable Insights**: Deriving meaningful conclusions from the comparison of AI-generated responses.

## Code
The following Python code integrates with OpenAI’s GPT and Hugging Face’s BERT models. It automates querying both APIs, compares their responses, and generates insights based on the analysis.

```python
import requests
import openai
import json
from difflib import SequenceMatcher
